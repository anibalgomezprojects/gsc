HOW DO I TO INCLUDE MY OWN TEMPLATES?
_____________

GSC V2.0 was designed for easy template integration too.
Paste your templates to 'templates' folder and link 'gsc.css' in to your template. Import The General Headers

Inside <head> label:

<!-- GENERAL HEADERS EXAMPLE -->
<link href="templates/YOURTHEME/gsc.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="templates/YOUTHEME/wordcloud.css" type="text/css"> 
<!-- GENERAL HEADERS EXAMPLE -->

We need 6 functions in our templates:

Inside <body> label:

Show Links <?php links(); ?>
Show Basket <?php basket(); ?>
Product List <?php shop(); ?>
Show Categories <?php categories(); ?>
Closing The Document <?php footer(); ?>

Optional (Tag Clouds)
For Search Enginee's <?php tags(); ?>

Easy Right?
